# Project Title

Mobile Flashcards

This project is designed to create an android app which will have the ability to be able to learn or revise on some topics to the user. User can create decks on different topics, on each deck user can add some cards.

Cards will have questions in the front and answer at it's back. After user have created the decks and added at least 1 card they can have quiz on that deck too which will display the score at the end.
